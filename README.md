# March’s Jobs Report Indicates Unemployment Rise

### Many fear the implications COVID-19 will have on the economy and jobs. March’s U.S. jobs report was released on the first Friday of the month but many did not expect to see an accurate reflection of what the labor market will look like in a post-pandemic America. The Report just missed the mark before the economy rolled over. However, early data suggests that the highest job losses came from leisure and entertainment, with restaurants and bars taking the hardest hit and affecting employment for those with lower wages.

The data was found from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics website, specially the unemployment indicator section that broke down unemployment rates by education level. https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?fq=survey:%5Bln%5D&s=popularity:D 


Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.

The unemployment for those with a bachlor's degree was surprisingly low, even after the March jobs report was released. For those with higher education levels, the unemployment rate rose to 2.5%, well below the national general avergae rate. Suggesting that even though COVID-19 put the economy in bad shape, so far many higher wage workers were able to retain their jobs. If higher wage workers ratin their jobs, this means after the economy opens back up, retaurants and bars may be able to recover faster than from the 2008 recession when high wage workers lost their jobs, this conclusion is because disposable income remains available.
