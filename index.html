          The Labor of Bureau Statistics’ jobs report was surveyed in the first
          half of March, just missing the mark before the economy rolled over.
          Additionally, February’s unemployment rate was still dropping as the
          economy added 237,000 jobs. A signal that the timing of this month’s
          report may not only be too early but cushioned by a strong job market
          that was at a 50-year low.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          In contrast, the third week of March saw 3.3 million unemployment
          claims followed by an additional 6.6 million Thursday morning, all
          numbers that won’t be included in tomorrow’s report. The consensus
          forecast had a huge range, from 100k jobs added to 1.25 million lost.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The factor that had the most impact on the downturn of the economy was
          the stay-at-home announcement, which began to be more heavily
          implement in mid-March. The phenomena caused a big wave of layoffs in
          jobs, as non-essential businesses were ordered to close or scale back,
          and consumers stopped going out and spending. Before the drastic
          measure was put in place, many businesses were reluctant to let
          employees go entirely.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “Employment is always a lagging indicator due to human nature because
          employers don’t want to fire people. You cut their hours instead,”
          said Dan North, Chief Economist for Euler Hermes.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Although the unemployment rate rose for all levels of wages,
          businesses that were hit the hardest were retaurants and bars,
          resulting in higher unemployment rates for lower wage jobs. The income
          group that was hit the hardest were workers with less than a high
          school degree.

          More accurate indicators to pay attention to this month are Weekly
          Number of Hours Worked and new job postings, both of which dropped
          dramatically. Indeed’s trends for job postings for hospitality and
          tourism plunged by 58% from this time last year. Even postings for
          jobs that can be done from home, such as software engineers, dropped
          by 6%.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “People focus on layoffs but the unseen force that drives employment
          growth down is a lack of hiring,” said Nick Bunker, Economic Research
          Director for Indeed.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The recently announced Cares Act attempts to mitigate job loss by
          offering small businesses forgivable loans if certain rules around
          retaining employees are followed. But parts of the Bill designed to
          help those that lose their job, such as increased access to
          unemployment benefits, gives companies a stronger incentive to let
          workers go, knowing they will be ok, a factor that may be driving
          unemployment up.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Early indications of job loss could be widespread across most
          industries but with a big concertation in leisure, entertainment and
          retail manufacturing. Additionally, indicators that are normally seen
          as a positive reflection on the economy could signal the opposite
          under current circumstances. One example is wages, since laid off
          workers are more likely to be in lower wage growth industries, as they
          drop off, the average wage rate would go up.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The long-term projection remains open ended as the driving force
          behind the crash is not economic, but a virus that’s behavior remains
          widely unknown. When and how the pandemic will end and if it becomes
          seasonal are all factors that will impact when the economy can start
          its recovery.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “Public health policy is economic policy and economic policy is health
          policy,” said Martha Gimbel, Manager of Economic Research for Schmidt
          Futures.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          If the pandemic continues for months and lock-down requests stay in
          place, the effects could be devastating. Economists’ forecast
          unemployment ranges from the low double digits to as far-fetched as
          30%.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The biggest worry is that when this is all over, businesses won’t want
          to invest in capital goods and infrastructure, and confidence in the
          market is lost, all of which would cause a permanent impact on the
          economy, jobs and a very long road to recovery.
